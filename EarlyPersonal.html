                <td>Vettel was born on 3 July 1987 in Heppenheim, West Germany, to Norbert and Heike Vettel. He has one younger brother,
                Fabian, a racing driver, and two older sisters: Melanie, a dental technician, and Stefanie, a physiotherapist for
                disabled children. Vettel suggested in an interview that he was "terrible" at school, but he passed his Abitur at
                Heppenheim's Starkenburg-Gymnasium  with a respectable grade. His childhood heroes were "The three Michaels":
                Michael Schumacher, Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson. He mentioned that he wanted to be a singer like Jackson, but
                realised that he did not have the voice. Vettel is also a fan of the Beatles, collecting several records, including
                Abbey Road and his favourite song being "Drive My Car". In an interview on Top Gear, he stated that he is a fan of
                British comedy such as Little Britain and Monty Python's Life of Brian. Vettel lives in Thurgovia, Switzerland, amongst
                other racing drivers and is a fan of German football team Eintracht Frankfurt. Vettel has described himself as
                competitive, private and impatient. He also appeared in advertisements for Head & Shoulders, and provided the voice
                of character Sebastian Schnell in the German version of the movie Cars 2.
                
                <p>Vettel married childhood friend Hanna Prater at a private ceremony in early 2019, and they have three
                children. In 2016, Forbes estimated that his annual income was $41 million. Kimi Räikkönen, his teammate
                from 2015 to 2018, is a close friend. Besides his native German, Vettel speaks English, French, Finnish and
                Italian. Vettel is also known for his avoidance of social media, and is the only Formula One driver on the 2022
                grid with no social media presence.</p></td>
