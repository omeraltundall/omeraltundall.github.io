                    Jacques Villeneuve as second driver for the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. On his testing debut, Vettel set the fastest
                    time in the second Friday free practice. Vettel became the then-youngest Formula One driver to participate in a
                    Grand Prix weekend at 19 years and 53 days. He also set a record for collecting his first fine in nine seconds into
                    his career, as Vettel exceeded the pitlane speed limit on the way to the track. In his second testing session at the
                    2006 Italian Grand Prix, he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions.</p>

                    Vettel was confirmed as BMW's test driver for 2007. Following Kubica's crash at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel was
                    named his replacement at the 2007 United States Grand Prix. He started in seventh position and finished in eighth to

                <td><p>BMW released him in July 2007 to join Red Bull's Scuderia Toro Rosso, replacing Scott Speed from the 2007 Hungarian
                Grand Prix onwards, as Vettel was already under contract to Red Bull Racing. It was also announced that he would
                drive for Toro Rosso in 2008 alongside Sébastien Bourdais</p>
                <p>
                    In the rain-affected Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji, Vettel worked his way up to third, behind Lewis Hamilton and Red
                     Bull
                    Racing's Mark Webber, and seemed to be on course for his and the team's maiden podium finish. However, Vettel
                    crashed
                    into Webber under safety car conditions, forcing both cars to retire. Webber said after the race: "It's kids isn't
                    it.
                     Kids with not enough experience – you do a good job and then they fuck it all up".[42] Vettel was initially punished
                    with a ten-place grid penalty for the following race, but this was lifted after a spectator video on YouTube showed
                    the
                    incident may have been caused by Hamilton's behaviour behind the safety car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vettel finished a career-best fourth a week later at the Chinese Grand Prix, having started 17th on the grid while in
                    mixed conditions. He was tipped by Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz as one of the sport's big future stars:
                    "Vettel is one of the young guys with extraordinary potential [...] He is fast, he is intelligent, and he is very
                    interested in the technical side."
                </p>
                <p>
                    After four races of the 2008 season, Vettel was the only driver to have failed to finish a single race, having retired
                    on the first lap in three of them. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Vettel scored his first points of the season with a
                    fifth-place finish, after qualifying 17th. Toro Rosso's technical director Giorgio Ascanelli explained that something
                    changed at the European Grand Prix in Valencia: "Suddenly Vettel understood something about how to drive an F1 car
                    quickly. It made a huge difference – not only to the speed he could unlock but also to his ability to do so
                    consistently."
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the wet Italian Grand Prix, Vettel became the youngest driver in history to win a Formula One Grand Prix, aged 21
                    years and 74 days. He led for the majority of the Grand Prix and crossed the finish line 12.5 seconds ahead of
                    McLaren's Heikki Kovalainen. It would also be Toro Rosso's only win. Earlier in the weekend, he had already
                    become the youngest pole-sitter. Toro Rosso team boss Gerhard Berger said: "As he proved today, he can win races,
                    but he's going to win World Championships. He's a cool guy". His victory led the German media to dub him "Baby
                    Schumi".
                </p>
                Vettel was named 2008 Rookie of the Year at the Autosport Awards.

                        At the start of the 2009 season, Vettel replaced the retired David Coulthard at Red Bull Racing. He began strongly at
                        the Australian Grand Prix, running in second for the majority of the race. However, a clash with Robert Kubica over
                        second place in the latter stages forced both to retire. He went on to take pole position and the race win at
                        Chinese Grand Prix; Red Bull Racing's maiden pole and win.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further wins followed in Great Britain, Japan and Abu Dhabi. He won the Japanese Grand Prix from pole position,
                        leading every lap. Vettel won the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the first ever day-night race, to finish second in
                        the World Drivers' Championship standings behind Jenson Button. He also scored his third fastest lap of the year,
                        drawing him level with teammate Mark Webber. However, as Vettel had more second fastest laps, he won the 2009 DHL
                        Fastest Lap Award.

                    <p>
                        Vettel took the first pole position of the 2010 season at the Bahrain Grand Prix. He led most of the race but as a
                        result of a spark plug failure, Vettel finished in fourth place. At the Australian Grand Prix, Vettel was appointed
                        as a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association. He took his first win of the season in Malaysia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Monaco, Vettel made it a Red Bull 1–2 with him second and Webber first. Both were equal on points in the standings,
                        with Webber first based on total wins. At the Turkish Grand Prix, Vettel was running second behind Webber when he
                        made a passing move on his teammate. The two collided, putting Vettel out of the race, with neither driver accepting
                        responsibility for the collision.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the British Grand Prix, both Vettel and Webber's cars were fitted with a new front wing design. Vettel's wing was
                        damaged in the third practice session, and Webber's sole surviving example was removed and given to his teammate.
                        Vettel qualified in first place, but suffered a puncture. He finished seventh while Webber took the victory. In Japan,
                        he qualified on pole ahead of Webber and went on to win with a lights-to-flag victory. Aged 23 years and 98 days, Vettel
                        became the youngest Grand Prix driver to win at the same track on two occasions. At the inaugural Korean Grand Prix,
                        Vettel led the first 45 laps before retiring with engine failure, handing victory to championship rival Fernando Alonso.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the 1–2 finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Vettel and Webber secured Red Bull Racing's first World Constructors'
                        Championship. Vettel went into the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi with a 15-point deficit to Alonso and a
                        7-point gap to Webber. He won the Grand Prix from pole to become the youngest World Drivers' Champion in the sport's
                        history, as Alonso only finished in seventh place. Following John Surtees in the 1964 season and James Hunt in 1976,
                        this was the third time in Formula One history that the title winner had not topped the championship table until after
                        the last race.

                    <p>
                        Vettel started the 2011 season with wins in Australia and Malaysia, before a second-place finish at the Chinese Grand
                        Prix due to poor tyre management, possibly related to his inability to properly communicate with his team, as his radio
                        was broken. In Monaco, Vettel led the race but due to another radio malfunction, the Red Bull pit crew was not
                        prepared when he came in. The pit stop was slow and he was sent out on the wrong tyres, handing the lead to Button.
                        Vettel switched to a one-stop strategy and stuck with one set of soft tyres for 56 laps. He was caught by Alonso and
                        Button as his tyres deteriorated, but neither were able to pass him. The race was red-flagged with few laps
                        remaining, which allowed teams to change their tyres; when the race was restarted under the safety car, Vettel was able
                        to retain the lead and win.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the European Grand Prix, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) enforced a ban on engine mappings. It
                        was believed by some in the press that this was an attempt by the FIA to thwart Vettel's early domination.
                        Nevertheless, he took pole with the fastest qualifying lap in Valencia Street Circuit's history. Vettel dominated with
                        his first hat-trick of 2011, and won his sixth race out of eight. The FIA implemented another rule change at the
                        British Grand Prix, targeting the blown diffusers. Red Bull believed the changes would cost them about half a second per
                        lap. During the race, Vettel held off Webber for second place, who ignored a radio message from team principal
                        Christian Horner to hold position. It was only the second time in the sport's history that a driver had finished
                        second or higher in each of the first nine races of a season and won at least six of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vettel's run of fourteen successive front-row starts and eleven successive top two finishes ended at his home race,
                        where he qualified third and finished fourth. In Italy, he took his tenth pole position of the year, in which he joined
                        Ayrton Senna as the only driver to have taken ten pole positions in two separate seasons. A podium finish in Japan
                        secured his second successive title with four races remaining, making him the youngest ever double and back-to-back
                        champion. Vettel won the following race in Korea to become the second driver to take at least ten wins in a season
                        after Michael Schumacher. He also helped to secure Red Bull's second successive World Constructors'
                        Championship. Vettel took his eleventh victory of the season in the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, leading every lap
                        from pole position, as well as setting the race's fastest lap to claim his first grand slam. Vettel broke the record
                        for the most pole positions in a season at the season finale in Brazil, after he clinched his 15th pole of the year.
                        He completed the year with 15 poles, 11 victories, and 17 podiums from 19 races; Vettel also earned a record total of
                        392 points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vettel started the 2012 season with a second place at the Australian Grand Prix, before he finished outside the points
                        in Malaysia following a collision with backmarker Narain Karthikeyan. Vettel and Horner criticised Karthikeyan's
                        driving, with Vettel calling him an "idiot", and a "cucumber". Karthikeyan hit back, calling Vettel a "cry
                        baby". Vettel crossed the line in first place at the Bahrain Grand Prix to go top of the championship standings.
                        Three races without a podium place followed, before he retired at the European Grand Prix after an alternator failure,
                        dropping him to fourth in the standings. In Germany, Vettel finished second behind Alonso but received a 20-second
                        time penalty after the race, as he was off the track when he overtook Button; Vettel dropped back to fifth. He
                        started in 10th place but finished second in Belgium to climb up to second place in the championship. Vettel then
                        retired at the Italian Grand Prix due to a alternator failure, which saw the gap to leader Alonso grow to 39 points with
                        seven races remaining. He won next race in Singapore, as he kept the lead until the 2-hour race limit was
                        reached. At the Japanese Grand Prix he took his second career grand slam and coupled with Alonso's retirement, he
                        cut the gap down to just four points. After winning at the Korean Grand Prix, the Indian Grand Prix brought another
                        victory, as Vettel topped all three practice sessions before taking pole position and leading every lap of the race to
                        win.
                        
                        During qualifying at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Vettel was told to stop the car due to a fuel pump issue; he was forced
                        to start from the pit lane. From last place, Vettel fought his way back to finish in third place. He started
                        the last race in Brazil with a 13-point cushion against Alonso. On the opening lap, Vettel spun after an incident
                        with Bruno Senna. Following changing weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to finish in sixth place to win the
                        championship by three points and to become the youngest ever triple world champion. He also became the third driver
                        to acquire three consecutive championships, after Juan Manuel Fangio and Schumacher.

                        that Vettel "will have protection as usual and that’s the way it goes". Team principal Horner, although unhappy
                        with Vettel's actions, pointed out that Webber had defied team orders on several previous occasions. He acknowledged
                        that the already fragile relationship between the two drivers had further broken down as a result of the incident.
                        Vettel claimed that he was not sorry for winning and that if the situation presented itself again, he would have passed
                        Webber despite the order, adding that he felt Webber did not deserve to win the race.

                        Following wins in Bahrain and Canada, his championship lead was cut at the British Grand Prix as he was denied a likely
                        win due to gearbox failure. Vettel bounced back to win his home race in Germany for the first time. After he finished
                        third in Hungary, Vettel won the last nine races of the season, including grand slams in Singapore and Korea. Vettel set
                        the record for most consecutive race wins with nine and he became only the third man after Alberto Ascari and Jim Clark
                        to take consecutive grand slams. He sealed his fourth world title at the Indian Grand Prix.

                    On several occasions during the season, spectators booed Vettel. Although the booing was widely condemned by fellow
                    drivers, the media and others in the paddock, Vettel revealed that it had a negative impact on him.

                        For the 2014 season and beyond, drivers picked a unique car number to use for the remainder of their Formula One career;
                        Vettel chose the number five. However, as reigning World Drivers' Champion, he carried number one throughout the
                        season. Webber left the sport and was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo, who was promoted from Toro Rosso.

                        Vettel struggled with reliability issues throughout winter testing, and forced him to retire at the opening Australian
                        Grand Prix. Reliability problems also forced Vettel to retire at the Monaco and Austrian Grands Prix. Vettel
                        qualified on the front-row for the races in Malaysia, Great Britain and Hungary, and finished on the podium in Malaysia,
                        Canada, Singapore and Japan. After the Russian Grand Prix, he had been outqualified by a teammate over a season for the
                        first time in his Formula One career. In addition to suffering reliability problems, throughout 2014 Vettel struggled to
                        get to grips with the Red Bull RB10, and the Pirelli tyres. He signed off the year by becoming the first
                        defending champion to fail to win a race during a season since Jacques Villeneuve in 1998.

                        In October, Red Bull had announced that Vettel would be leaving the team at the end of the season to join Scuderia
                        Ferrari, one year before his contract was due to expire. Vettel replaced Alonso and partnered his friend Kimi
                        Räikkönen. Vettel mentioned he would like to drive for Ferrari at some point in his career and was already rumoured
                        in 2012 to have a non-binding pre-contract, with options, to join them in 2014. He was denied an early release from
                        his Red Bull contract to test the 2014 Ferrari car in Abu Dhabi. In spite of this, Vettel was present at the
                        Ferrari test – although not driving the car – but Red Bull did not enforce any sanctions. Vettel instead made his
                        first appearance in November, completing nearly 100 laps in the 2012 car around the test track of Fiorano.

                        Vettel made his Ferrari debut by finishing third in the Australian Grand Prix. He followed that up with
                        winning the
                        Malaysian Grand Prix, his first race victory for over a year and the first win for Ferrari for almost
                        two years.
                        After the race, an emotional Vettel paid tribute to Schumacher, saying that his hero's achievements with
                        Ferrari made
                        the first win all the more special.

                    <p>
                        He won the Hungarian Grand Prix to remain a championship contender after he started from third on the
                        grid. He dedicated
                        his victory to the driver Jules Bianchi, who died the week prior from injuries sustained in 2014. At the
                        halfway
                        point of the season, Vettel was 42 points behind championship leader and Mercedes driver Hamilton.
                        Vettel was in
                        third place in Belgium when his right rear blew at high speed on the penultimate lap, likely ending any
                        title chances
                        given Hamilton's win. After the race, he ranted about the 'unacceptable' and 'unsafe' Pirelli tyres that
                        could have
                        caused him serious injury.

                    <p>
                        Vettel came home second in the Italian Grand Prix, his first race with Ferrari at the team's home soil.
                        He then
                        took his first pole with the team at the Singapore Grand Prix, Ferrari's first pole for three years.
                        Vettel went on
                        to win the race, and with Hamilton retiring, he closed to within 49 points with seven races remaining
                        Vettel ended
                        the season in third place, however, with three wins and 13 podiums; he declared the season as a
                        'miracle'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a third-place finish at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix, Vettel's participation in Bahrain ended
                        without
                        starting as his car broke down on the formation lap. At the Chinese Grand Prix, Vettel collided with
                        teammate
                        Räikkönen on the first lap, but both were able to continue. He blamed Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat for
                        the collision,
                        labelling him a "madman" and described his overtaking manoeuvre as "suicidal". At the Russian Grand
                        Prix, Vettel
                        retired on the first lap after two consecutive collisions with Kvyat. At the Mexican Grand Prix, Vettel
                        attempted
                        to overtake Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, but after Verstappen ran off the track and rejoined ahead of
                        him, Vettel
                        verbally attacked him and race director Charlie Whiting, for which he later apologised. Vettel then
                        blocked Red
                        Bull's Ricciardo by moving in the braking zone, and was given a ten-second penalty and two points on his
                        licence.
                        Although he achieved seven podium finishes during the season, Vettel did not win any races in 2016.

                    following races, winning in Bahrain and Monaco, and finishing second in China, Russia and Spain. In
                    Russia, Vettel took his first pole position in 18 months and with Räikkönen alongside him, Ferrari had their first front
                    row lock out since the 2008 French Grand Prix. Vettel's lead at the top of the standings increased to 25 points
                    after the Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari's first victory at the circuit since Schumacher won there in 2001.</p> 
                    <p>
                        In Azerbaijan, Vettel collided into the rear of race leader Hamilton under the safety car, accusing Hamilton of brake
                        testing him. Moments later, Vettel pulled alongside and hit his Mercedes as they prepared for a restart, for which
                        he received a ten-second stop-go penalty. The FIA investigated the Vettel-Hamilton incident further, but Vettel
                        received no punishment. Vettel took full responsibility, issuing a public apology and committing to devote personal time
                        over the next 12 months to educational activities across a variety of FIA championships and events.

                        Vettel's championship lead was cut to only a single point in Great Britain, as he suffered a puncture on the penultimate
                        lap and dropped to seventh place. Vettel started from pole in Hungary, and maintained the lead. He overcame
                        steering issues and held on for victory, which gave him a 14-point lead over Hamilton. Mercedes dominated after the
                        summer break and Vettel lost the championship lead at the Italian Grand Prix, which was followed by a first-lap
                        retirement in Singapore after collision with Räikkönen and Verstappen. It was the first time in Formula One history that
                        both Ferraris retired from the first lap of a Grand Prix. His title hopes were dealt another blow in Malaysia, as
                        he started last following a turbo problem in qualifying. He finished in fourth place, but crashed with Williams' Lance
                        Stroll on the cool-down lap; neither would be penalised. More reliability issues befell Ferrari in Japan as Vettel
                        retired due to a spark plug failure. In Mexico, Vettel became the fourth driver in Formula One history to claim 50
                        pole positions. Verstappen took the lead from Vettel at the start, before Vettel collided with Hamilton, after
                        which Hamilton won his fourth title. For the first time in his career, Vettel failed to win the World Drivers'
                        Championship having led it at some stage during a season.

                    <p>
                        The 2018 season was dubbed the "Fight For Five" by the media, as for the first time in Formula One history, two
                        quadruple world champions lined up at the start of a season. For the second consecutive year, Vettel began the
                        season with victory in Australia, after he took the lead while pitting under the virtual safety car. It was his
                        100th podium, while he also became only the third man in Formula One history to have led 3,000 laps. In Bahrain,
                        Vettel maintained the lead from pole through the first round of pit stops and held off Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas despite
                        being on old soft tyres to take a record fourth victory at the circuit. At the Chinese Grand Prix, he was hit by
                        Verstappen in the latter stages of the race, which caused both to spin. Vettel limped home in eighth place, with his
                        championship lead reduced to nine points. For the first time since 2013, Vettel took three consecutive pole
                        positions as he qualified in first place in Azerbaijan. It was the 23rd different Grand Prix at which he had taken pole
                        position, equalling Hamilton's record.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel won for the third time in 2018 and for the 50th time in his career, becoming only the
                        fourth man to reach a half-century of wins. The following race in France, Vettel lost the championship lead
                        following a collision with Bottas. He bounced back in Great Britain, after he passed Bottas in the last laps to
                        take victory. Vettel led his home race until he slid off the track and hit the wall in the latter stages as rain
                        started to fall, as he had clipped the sausage curb a few laps before, breaking a part of his front wing, causing
                        understeer and loss of downforce; he won in Belgium, however, in which he passed Hamilton for the race
                        victory. Contact on the opening lap with Hamilton in Italy saw Vettel damage his front wing and drop to the back of
                        the field, but he recovered to cross the finishing line in fourth place. It left Vettel 30 points behind the Mercedes
                        driver with seven races left. His championship hopes were dealt a further blow as Ferrari's upgrades introduced at
                        the Singapore Grand Prix proved to be unsuccessful, making a step backwards on car development; Ferrari suffered a dip
                        of form until the United States Grand Prix, where they reverted to their old package and successfully rediscovered their
                        form. Vettel claimed his first ever podium in Mexico but the World Drivers' Championship went to Hamilton for
                        a second consecutive year. Although Mercedes had been the more consistent and better team, fans and pundits
                        criticised Vettel for making too many mistakes during the season.

                            After showing impressive pace throughout pre-season testing in Barcelona, Vettel and his new teammate Charles Leclerc
                            headed to Australia with many pundits believing they had the car to beat for the 2019 season. The opening weekend
                            proved to be difficult, however, as Vettel qualified some seven tenths off pole position in third and finished the race
                            in fourth place. Third-place finishes in China and Azerbaijan followed, as Mercedes continued to dominate.
                            Vettel took pole position in Canada; his first pole in 17 races.Midway through the race, a snap of oversteer
                            caused him to run wide onto the grass. Vettel received a five-second time penalty from the stewards, who believed he had
                            returned to the track "in an unsafe manner and forced [Hamilton] off track". Vettel crossed the line in first place
                            but lost his victory as a result of the penalty. After the race, he swapped the number one and two signs in front of
                            Hamilton's Mercedes and the empty spot that was supposed for his own car, as Vettel parked his car at the start of the
                            pit entry. At the German Grand Prix, Vettel was unable to qualify after a turbo issue, which meant he would start
                            in last place. During a race with mixed weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to second place In Italy, Vettel
                            spun at the Ascari chicane and when he re-entered the track, he made contact with Racing Point's Stroll. Vettel received
                            a 10-second stop-go penalty and finished in 13th place. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Vettel won on a circuit
                            Ferrari were expected to struggle at. For the first time, Vettel had won five times at the same track. The
                            following race, in Russia, Vettel went from third place on the grid to first place in the first corner. However, radio
                            transmissions suggested that the team wanted to swap their drivers, but with Vettel the quicker driver, he remained in
                            front. Vettel retired soon after with a MGU-K problem.

                            Vettel took pole position in Japan, but an abrupt start off the line caused him to momentarily stop before getting
                            away, which allowed Bottas to take the lead; Vettel was not penalized for his jump start. After running in third at
                            the Brazilian Grand Prix for the majority of the race, a safety car allowed Red Bull's Alexander Albon and an aggressive
                            Leclerc to overtake him. He tried to pass his teammate immediately but the two Ferraris collided, resulting in another
                            retirement for Vettel. He finished fifth in the World Drivers' Championship, and was outscored by a teammate for
                            only the second time across a season.

                            Ferrari later announced they would not extend Vettel's contract beyond the 2020 season. Team principal Mattia Binotto
                            explained there was "no specific reason" for the decision, though both parties noted it was an amicable agreement.
                            The season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the first ten races of the original calendar were either
                            rescheduled, postponed or cancelled altogether. Ferrari discovered problems on their car following pre-season testing,
                            forcing them to make a major redesign.

                            The SF1000 lacked pace as Vettel finished the season's opening race in Austria in 10th place. During the weekend,
                            he was also given a warning for breaching the FIA's COVID-19 protocols after he was seen mixing with members of his
                            former team Red Bull. The following race, at the Styrian Grand Prix, Vettel retired on the opening lap with rear
                            wing damage following a collision with Leclerc. He ended the season in a disappointing 13th place in the Drivers'
                            standings, with a third place in Turkey as his best result. Ferrari only finished sixth in the Constructors'
                            standings, their worst result since 1980, while Vettel's total of 33 points was the lowest in a full campaign in his
                            Formula One career.

                        Vettel joined Aston Martin for the 2021 season, replacing Sergio Pérez. In his debut race weekend in Bahrain, he
                        received a grid penalty in qualifying, forcing him to start last. While Vettel started well, he had a collision with
                        Esteban Ocon, giving him a time penalty and ended up finishing in 15th place. He received five penalty points on his
                        superlicence. Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer reported no concerns, owing to this being a very
                        different car from the Ferrari, lack of laps in pre-season testing and a very impressive race start. In the fifth
                        race of the season, Vettel scored his first points for the team with a fifth-place finish in Monaco. At the
                        following race, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, he claimed Aston Martin's first podium with a second-place finish.
                        Vettel also finished second in Hungary, but was later disqualified, after his car failed to provide the one litre sample
                        of fuel required. He ended the season in 12th place in the Drivers' standings, ahead of teammate Stroll.
                        During the season, Vettel made 132 overtakes—the most of any driver—and won the inaugural Overtake Award.

                        Vettel missed the first two races of the 2022 season in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia after testing positive for COVID-19; he
                        was substituted by Aston Martin's reserve driver Nico Hülkenberg.
