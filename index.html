                    <td colspan="2">Sebastian Vettel born 3 July 1987 is a German racing driver
                    who competes in Formula One for Aston Martin, having previously driven for BMW Sauber, Toro Rosso, Red Bull, and
                    Ferrari. Vettel has won four World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2010 to 2013. Vettel is
                    the youngest World Champion in Formula 1. He also has the third-most race victories (53) and podium finishes (122) and
                    fourth-most pole positions (57).
                    
                    <p>Vettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off racing appearance in
                    2007. Part of the Red Bull young-driver programme, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later that year and was kept as a
                    full-time driver for 2008. Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles
                    from 2010 to 2013, the first of which made him the sport's youngest World Champion, setting the records for the most
                    consecutive race wins (9) and race wins in a single season (13). Vettel signed for Ferrari for 2015 and became
                    Mercedes' and Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018, although he finished both years
                    as runner-up.</p> </td>
